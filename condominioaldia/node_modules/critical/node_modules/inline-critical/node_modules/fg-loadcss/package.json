  "readme": "# loadCSS\n\nA function for loading CSS asynchronously\n[c]2017 @scottjehl, @zachleat [Filament Group, Inc.](https://www.filamentgroup.com/)\nLicensed MIT\n\n## Why loadCSS?\n\nReferencing CSS stylesheets with `link[rel=stylesheet]` or `@import` causes browsers to delay page rendering while a stylesheet loads. When loading stylesheets that are not critical to the initial rendering of a page, this blocking behavior is undesirable. The new `<link rel=\"preload\">` standard enables us to load stylesheets asynchronously, without blocking rendering, and loadCSS provides a JavaScript polyfill for that feature to allow it to work across browsers, as well as providing its own JavaScript method for loading stylesheets.\n\n* Latest release: https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS/releases\n* NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/fg-loadcss\n\n## Recommended loadCSS Usage\n\nLoadCSS is designed for loading CSS that is **not critical** to the initial rendering of the page, and desirable to load in an asynchronous manner. (_For the critical CSS rules, we recommend either inlining that CSS in a `style` element, or referencing it externally and server-pushing it using http/2. [Read more here](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/modernizing-delivery.html)_)\n\nThe standard markup pattern for loading files asynchronously is: `<link rel=\"preload\">` ([W3C Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-preload-20150721/)). We recommend using this markup pattern to reference your non-critical CSS files. `loadCSS` and its rel=preload polyfill are designed to enable this markup to work in browsers that don't yet support this feature.\n\nFor each CSS file you'd like to load asynchronously, use a `link` element like this:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"path/to/mystylesheet.css\" as=\"style\">\n```\n\nIn browsers that support it, the `rel=preload` attribute will cause the browser to fetch the stylesheet, but it will not **apply** the CSS once it is loaded (it merely fetches it). To address this, we recommend using an `onload` attribute on the `link` that will do that for us as soon as the CSS finishes loading.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"path/to/mystylesheet.css\" as=\"style\" onload=\"this.rel='stylesheet'\">\n```\n\nThis step requires JavaScript to be enabled, so we recommend including an ordinary reference to your stylesheet inside a `noscript` element as a fallback.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"path/to/mystylesheet.css\" as=\"style\" onload=\"this.rel='stylesheet'\">\n<noscript><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path/to/mystylesheet.css\"></noscript>\n```\n\nAfter linking to your asynchronous stylesheet(s) this way, include the [loadCSS script](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS/blob/master/src/loadCSS.js), as well as the [loadCSS rel=preload polyfill script](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS/blob/master/src/cssrelpreload.js) in your page. These can be inlined or linked and http/2-pushed if possible.\nHere's how they would look inlined in the page:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"path/to/mystylesheet.css\" as=\"style\" onload=\"this.rel='stylesheet'\">\n<noscript><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path/to/mystylesheet.css\"></noscript>\n<script>\n/*! loadCSS. [c]2017 Filament Group, Inc. MIT License */\n(function(){ ... }());\n/*! loadCSS rel=preload polyfill. [c]2017 Filament Group, Inc. MIT License */\n(function(){ ... }());\n</script>\n```\nThese scripts will automatically detect if a browser supports `rel=preload`. In browsers that natively support `rel=preload`, these scripts will do nothing, allowing the browser to load and apply the asynchronous CSS (note the `onload` attribute above, which is there to set the `link`'s `rel` attribute to stylesheet once it finishes loading in browsers that support `rel=preload`). In browsers that do not support `rel=preload`, they will find CSS files referenced this way in the DOM and load and apply them asynchronously using the loadCSS function.\n\nNote: regardless of whether the browser supports `rel=preload` or not, a CSS file will be referenced from the same location in the source order as your original `link` element. Keep this in mind, as you may want to place the `link` in a particular location in your `head` element so that the CSS loads with an expected cascade order. Also, any `media` attribute value on the original link element will be retained when the polyfill is in play.\n\nYou can view a demo of this `rel=preload` pattern here: https://master-origin-loadcss.fgview.com/test/preload.html\n\n\n## Manual CSS loading with loadCSS\n\nThe [loadCSS.js](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS/blob/master/src/loadCSS.js) file exposes a global `loadCSS` function that you can call to load CSS files programmatically, when needed.\n\n```css\nloadCSS( \"path/to/mystylesheet.css\" );\n```\n\nThe code above will insert a new CSS stylesheet `link` *after* the last stylesheet or script that it finds in the page, and the function will return a reference to that `link` element, should you want to reference it later in your script. Multiple calls to loadCSS will reference CSS files in the order they are called, but keep in mind that they may finish loading in a different order than they were called.\n\n## Function API\n\nIf you're calling loadCSS manually (without the `rel=preload` pattern, the function has 3 optional arguments.\n\n- `before`: By default, loadCSS attempts to inject the stylesheet link *after* all CSS and JS in the page. However, if you desire a more specific location in your document, such as before a particular stylesheet link, you can use the `before` argument to specify a particular element to use as an insertion point. Your stylesheet will be inserted *before* the element you specify. For example, here's how that can be done by simply applying an `id` attribute to your `script`.\n\t``` html\n<head>\n...\n<script id=\"loadcss\">\n  // load a CSS file just before the script element containing this code\n  loadCSS( \"path/to/mystylesheet.css\", document.getElementById(\"loadcss\") );\n</script>\n...\n</head>\n```\n\n- `media`: You can optionally pass a string to the media argument to set the `media=\"\"` of the stylesheet - the default value is `all`.\n\n#### Using with `onload`\n\nOnload event support for `link` elements is spotty in some browsers, so if you need to add an onload callback, include [`onloadCSS` function](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS/blob/master/src/onloadCSS.js) on your page and use the `onloadCSS` function:\n\n``` javascript\nvar stylesheet = loadCSS( \"path/to/mystylesheet.css\" );\nonloadCSS( stylesheet, function() {\n\tconsole.log( \"Stylesheet has loaded.\" );\n});\n```\n\n### Browser Support\n\nloadCSS attempts to load a css file asynchronously in any JavaScript-capable browser. However, some older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 and older will block rendering while the stylesheet is loading. This merely means that the stylesheet will load as if you referenced it with an ordinary link element.\n\n\n#### Contributions and bug fixes\n\nBoth are very much appreciated - especially bug fixes. As for contributions, the goals of this project are to keep things very simple and utilitarian, so if we don't accept a feature addition, it's not necessarily because it's a bad idea. It just may not meet the goals of the project. Thanks!\n",
