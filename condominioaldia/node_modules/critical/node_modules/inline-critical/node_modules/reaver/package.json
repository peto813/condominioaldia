Directories and missing files are ignored.\n\nIf a `manifest: true` option is passed, it returns a map of file paths to the resulting hashes. The manifest always uses absolute paths.\n\n### `reaver.rev(file, data)`\n\nThis method will just return the hashed filename based on the provided data, without accessing the file system.\n\n### Circular Dependencies\n\nWhen you have circular dependencies, you can use `--consider <file>`. Suppose you have `app.js` and `service-worker.js`. `app.js` references the worker to install it, and the worker references `app.js` to download it for offline-first. You can `--consider service-worker.js` when hashing `app.js` so that the contents of service-worker are factored in the hashing of `app.js`, so that even though `app.js` itself hasn't changed, the hash will change if the contents of `service-worker.js` have changed.\n\nWithout this option, you would keep changing the hashes for each file as the reference to the other file changes in each other.\n\n## CLI\n\nUsage\n\n```shell\nreaver [options] [file] [file] [file]\n```\n\nInvokes the `reaver(files, options)` API method, using `minimist` for option parsing.\n\n\n## Example\n\nUsage example below\n\n```shell\ntouch foo{,.js}\nreaver *\nls\n# foo.d41d8cd9    foo.d41d8cd9.js\n```\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n",
